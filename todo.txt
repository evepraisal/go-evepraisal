TODO:
	- Delete appraisals for logged in users
	- History pagination
    - Add total number of unpriced items (because no order volume or BPCs) somewhere
    - Blueprint copy prices
      - (price of item - price of materials) * number of runs
    - Import of "popular" and recent appraisals (partially done)
    - Database backups (through local management HTTP API)

Weird results to look into:
 - Looks like it's an asset list: https://evepraisal.com/a/bwpy0.raw
